React Course Notes:
-------------------------------

Five major peices to a react component:
1. Constructor
   - We initialize state here and bind any functions to the "this" context.
2. Child functions
   - Called by render for actions like change or click.
3. Render function
   - Calls a child component. Markup should be kept seperate. Ideally just call child component
     that contains markup.
4. PropTypes
   - Used to ensure props validation.
5. Redux connect and related functions:
   - connect()
   - mapsStateToProps()
   - mapDispatchToProps()
